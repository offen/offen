# Installation tutorials

These tutorials walks you through the steps needed to setup and deploy an Offen instance.

Other and more complex configuration options are documented in ["Configuring the application at runtime"][config-docs]. General considerations for deploying Offen are described in ["Requirements for installing Offen"][installation].

If you're curious about how we deploy Offen ourselves, head over to our [`offen/deployment` repository][deployment-repo] which contains all of the code we use released under an MIT License.

If you have questions about configuring and deploying Offen on Ubuntu or any other Linux system that are not covered in this tutorial feel free to [open an issue in our GitHub repository][issues] or send us an email at <hioffen@posteo.de>.
