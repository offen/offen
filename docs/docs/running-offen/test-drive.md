# Test drive

If you just want to experiment with Offen or give it a quick test drive, you can run the application in demo mode.

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
curl -sS https://demo.offen.dev | bash  
```
{: .mb-8 }

You can do the same using our official Docker image:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 9876:9876 offen/offen:latest demo -port 9876  
```
{: .mb-8 }

If you have already downloaded the binaries use:

```bash
./offen demo  
```
{: .mb-8 }

Head to the URL printed in the terminal and start your testing. You can log in using the account `demo@offen.dev` and password `demo`.
