# Setup

## First run

After cloning the [repository][], you will need to do two things:

1. Pull the required Docker images and install each container's dependencies:

```bash
make setup
```

1. Bootstrap the development database:

```bash
make bootstrap
```

You should now be able to start your local version of Offen using:

```bash
make up
```

To log into the development backend use the following credentials:

```
Email: develop@offen.dev
Password: development
```

To see if the application is working as intended visit <http://localhost:8080> in your browser or use the application's health check:

```console
âžœ  ~ curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/healthz
{"ok":true}
```

You can stop the application using `Ctrl+C`, in case you want to tear down the current environment and delete the data stored in the local database you can use:

```bash
make down
```

## Updating dependencies

In case the dependencies consumed by one of the containers have changed, you can run the following command to get an up-to-date version:

```bash
make update
```

## Rebuilding Docker images

In case the Dockerfiles defining the development images have changes you will need to rebuild the local images using:

```bash
make dev-build
```

## Running database migrations

If your local database schema is out of date and you need to apply the latest migrations, run

```bash
make migrate
```
