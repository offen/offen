![Essential metrics](https://offen.github.io/press-kit/offen-material/gfx-GitHub-Metrics.svg)

## Objectives

__Privacy friendly__  
Collection of usage data is opt in, users that do not actively opt in will never leave a trace.
After opt in, Offen Fair Web Analytics collects the minimal amount of data needed to generate meaningful statistics for operators.
No IPs, User-Agent strings or similar are being collected or even looked at.

__Secure__  
Data in Offen Fair Web Analytics is encrypted End-To-End.
Clients encrypt usage data before it leaves the browser and there is no way for the server storing this data to decrypt it.
Attackers have no means to compromise an instance, accidental data leaks cannot expose user data.

__Self hosted and lightweight__  
You can run Offen Fair Web Analytics on-premises, or in any other deployment scenario that fits your need.
All you need to do is download a single binary file or pull a Docker image, and run it on your server.
Offen Fair Web Analytics will automatically install and renew SSL certificates for you if you want it to.
If you do not want to deploy a dedicated database, you can use SQLite to store data directly on the server.

__Transparent and fair__  
Offen Fair Web Analytics treats the user as a party of equal importance in the collection of usage data.
Users have access to the same set of tools for analyzing their own data and they can delete their data at any time.

## Localize
